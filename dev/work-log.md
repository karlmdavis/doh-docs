Work Log
========
*Tracking Work on my personal site.*


## Introduction

This log just tracks my work on the site. It's basically intended as an "electronic bookmark": helping me keep my place, so I don't forget what I was up to. I tend to work on the site intermittently (and often infrequently), so that's been a problem. But no more!

This file should never be committed along with other files; it should always be updated by itself. This will prevent any weird merge problems.

        * This Wikipedia article is **excellent**: [Software development effort estimation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development_effort_estimation)
        * I read through the abstract and conclusion of this excellent paper (which was referenced from Wikipedia): [Forecasting of Software Development Work Effort: Evidence on Expert Judgment and Formal Models](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.387.5379&rep=rep1&type=pdf)
            * It references an earlier 2004 paper by the same author that it sounds like I should track down and read as well.
