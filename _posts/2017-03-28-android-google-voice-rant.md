After mostly working from home for over 3 years, I've learned that I actually... kind of miss commuting? It's weird I know, but I've realized that a (reasonable) commute provides time in the morning to let my mind wander and mentally prepare for the day and time after work to decompress. See also: podcasts. Working from home, I don't have that built-in excuse to take some mental "me" time, and I miss that. Intentional meditation helps a lot, but I'm not great at remembering to carve out the time for it.

Today, I had a couple of excuses to head into and work from DC for the day, so I did. And the drive in was wonderful: mostly back roads, light traffic, and pouring rain for most of it. The rain on the car's roof reminded me of wonderful nights out camping in a tent during the rain. On the drive home, I found my mind wandering to business ideas. Nothing new there: I've got a whole list of them that I've been building for years, like a lot of other software/product nerds, I'm sure. One thing I've learned about these ideas, though, is that if I don't capture them immediately they often disappear forever.

Good thing I had Android Auto with its Google Voice (i.e. "Ok Google") integration in our fancy new car! I'll just use that to record all of these!

> Ok Google, note to self: business idea: uh... _(It stops listening and tells me how to save a note.)_

> Ok Google, note to self: business idea for a podcast that focuses... _(It stops listening and tells me how to save a note.)_

> Ok Google, note to self: just had a business idea f... _(It stops listening and tells me how to save a note.)_

> Ok Google, make a note. _(Wait for it to ask me what the note is. It doesn't.)_

> Ok Google, Hangouts chat with Karl... _(It stops listening and tells me how I can ask for directions.)_

> Ok Google, email to karl@justdavis.com. _(Wait for it to ask me what the email is. It doesn't.)_

> Ok Google, what the fuck _can_ you do? _(It doesn't understand the question.)_

This went on. And on. And on. For **24** times! Gah! By the end, I was angry enough that I was trying to get it to save a note to track down the devs responsible for this mess and rant at them.

Did you know that Google provides a page where you can listen to (and, it turns out, count) all of your attempts to get Google Voice to listen to you? Check out [Google - My Activity - Audio](https://myaccount.google.com/activitycontrols/audio). It's super useful for reminding you just how angry you were.

It's now an hour and a half later. I'm home. But I'm still super upset about this. The thing that's really killing me is that I use this feature all the time, to great success. I use Google Voice constantly at home to set reminders, to set timers, and to add things to our shopping list. And I've used it while driving, too. Looking back, I now realize that I've always had more luck at home than in the car, but it's never been _this_ bad before. What happened?

And why can't it provide better feedback? Every time it failed, it'd tell me how to save a note... using the **exact** same phrasing I'd just tried. Could it not hear me over the road noise? I don't think so, because the transcripts provided in the dashboard they provide look mostly correct. So what was the problem? I have no clue.

Having problems with this feature while driving is _particularly_ galling because I'm trapped: I don't have any other alternatives. I mean, I suppose I could call my wife and ask her to write things down for me, but that's not really fair to her — she was happily sitting at home, playing the new Zelda.

Thinking about this, I realized that this ties in a bit to a hot topic in the dev community: ChatOps. Personally, I don't see the appeal of the concept. IRC is great when I have a specific question, but I don't have the time to just hang out there. Same with Slack: it's a very slick app, but I avoid it like the plague because I already have way too much trouble just staying on top of my email. But in a way, the promise of Google Voice/Alexa/Siri/whatever is that they provide all of us with a ChatOps system for our lives. A conversational interface that we can use to get things done when our hands are busy.

But they only deliver on that promise when they work.
