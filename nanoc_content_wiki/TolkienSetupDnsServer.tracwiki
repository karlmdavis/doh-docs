This TolkienSetup sub-guide describes the steps necessary to make the computer a DNS server.

The DNS Server will be used to host the `madrivercode.com` domain, which was registered with [http://1and1.com/ 1&1 Internet].


== Installing BIND ==

If you selected the "DNS server" task during OS install, this should already be installed.  To verify, run the following command:
{{{
$ tasksel --list-tasks | grep dns
}}}

To see the packages installed for the task, run:
{{{
$ tasksel --task-packages dns-server
}}}

If you need to install this task, run:
{{{
# tasksel install dns-server
}}}


== DNS Zone: `madrivercode.com` ==

If it doesn't already exist, create a `zones` folder:
{{{
# mkdir /etc/bind/zones
}}}

Create a `/etc/bind/zones/madrivercode.com.db` file with the following contents:
{{{
$ORIGIN madrivercode.com.
$TTL 1h ; sets the default time-to-live for this zone

; name ttl class rr    name-server                 email-addr  (sn ref ret ex min)
@          IN    SOA   ns1.madrivercode.com.   hostmaster.madrivercode.com. (
                              2009031400 ; sn = serial number (yyyymmdd##)
                              2d         ; ref = refresh
                              15M        ; ret = update retry
                              4W         ; ex = expiry
                              1h         ; min = minimum
                              )

; Nameserver Records
; name             ttl    class   rr                name
@                         IN      NS                ns1

; IPv4 Address Records
; name             ttl    class   rr                name
@                         IN      A                 75.146.134.35
ns1                       IN      A                 75.146.134.35
tolkien                   IN      A                 75.146.134.35

; CNAME Records
; name             ttl    class   rr                name
www                       IN      CNAME             tolkien
}}}

Edit the `/etc/bind/named.conf.local` file and and the following lines to the end:
{{{
# List other trusted name servers that are allowed to request zone transfers:
acl trusted-servers  {
        74.208.2.6;  // 1and1 secondary name server (domain: slv1.1and1.com)
        217.160.224.4;  // 1and1 secondary name server (domain: slv1.1and1.com)
};

# Forward definition for madrivercode.com:
zone "madrivercode.com" {
	type master;
	file "/etc/bind/zones/madrivercode.com.db";
	allow-transfer { trusted-servers; };
};
}}}

Edit the `/etc/bind/named.conf.options` file and set the `forwarders` block up as follows:
{{{
	forwarders {
		68.87.85.98;
		68.87.69.146;
	};
}}}

Restart the `bind` service:
{{{
# /etc/init.d/bind9 restart
}}}

Use the domain registrar's tools to register this computer as the domain's primary DNS server:
 1. Log in to [http://admin.1and1.com] control panel.
 1. Go to the "Manage Domains" area.
 1. Create a subdomain that points to this computer's IP:
    1. Go to ''New'', ''Create Subdomain''.
    1. Create a new `dns` subdomain.
    1. Edit that subdomain's DNS settings to point to `75.146.134.35` as it's primary A record.
 1. Edit the `madrivercode.com`'s DNS settings as follows:
    * ''Name server'': My name server
    * ''Primary name server'': `dns.madrivercode.com`
    * ''Secondary name server'': 1and1 name server


== Reverse DNS ==

You will need to contact Comcast business support at 1-800-316-1619 and request that they create a reverse DNS entry for `75.146.134.35` that points to:
 * `tolkien.madrivercode.com`
 * `ns1.madrivercode.com`
