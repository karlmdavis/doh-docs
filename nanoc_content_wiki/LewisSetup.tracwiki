= LewisSetup =

`lewis` is a directory server which hosts DNS, Kerberos, and LDAP.  This page documents everything done to get `lewis` up, running, and configured.

'''Specs:'''

 * `lewis` is a virtual machine client running on `eddings`
 * Number of Processors: One
 * Hard disk size (preallocated): 20GB
 * Memory: 512MB
 * Network Connection: bridged networking

Please see the following sub-guides:

 * LewisSetupDnsServer: describes the steps necessary to make the computer a DNS server
 * LewisSetupKerberosServer: describes the steps necessary to make the computer a Kerberos server
 * LewisSetupLdapServer: describes the steps necessary to make the computer an LDAP server


== Create New Virtual Machine Client ==

Create a new client for the `lewis` virtual machine:

 1. Connect to the virtual machine console on the host server.
 1. Create a new virtual machine, using the '''Specs''' listed above.


== 32bit Ubuntu 8.04 (Hardy Heron), Server Edition ==


=== Installation Media ===

Acquire and prepare the installer:

 1. Find a URL for the appropriate installer `.iso` file at [http://www.ubuntu.com/getubuntu/download].
 1. Use the `wget` command on the virtual machine's host to download that `.iso`.
 1. Mount that `.iso` file as a CD via the virtual machine console.


=== Installation ===

Boot from the "CD" created earleir (press `ESC` at the POST screen).  Select the following options to proceed through the install:

 1. ''English''.
 1. ''Install Ubuntu Server''.
 1. Choose a language: ''English''
 1. Choose a country, territory, or state: ''United States''
 1. Keyboard layout: ''us''
 1. Hostname: `lewis`
 1. Time zone: ''Arizona''
 1. Partitioning method: ''Guided - use entire disk''
 1. Disk to partition: whichever represents the SATA drive (''SCSI3'' for me)
 1. Full name: `Karl M. Davis`
 1. Username: `karl`
 1. Password: (be sure to note this in `Identity.ods`)
 1. Software to install: ''OpenSSH Server'' (we'll install some of the others later)


== Network Connection ==

Assign the server a static public IP:

 1. Edit the `/etc/network/interfaces` file and set the `eth0` section as follows:

{{{
auto eth0
iface eth0 inet static
        address 75.146.134.36
        netmask 255.255.255.248
        gateway 75.146.134.38
}}}

 1. Restart networking:

{{{
# /etc/init.d/networking restart
}}}


== Connecting via SSH ==

After the network connection has been setup, you should be able to connect to the computer from other hosts via the following SSH command:

{{{
$ ssh karl@75.146.134.36
}}}


== Keeping the Clock Synchronized ==

References:

 * https://help.ubuntu.com/8.04/serverguide/C/NTP.html

As a virtual machine guest, the computer's clock will tend to "drift" faster than normal.  To correct this, simply install `ntpd` via the following command:
{{{
# apt-get install ntp
}}}
