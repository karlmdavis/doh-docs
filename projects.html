			<h2>Blue Button, Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services</h2>
			<p>The <a href="https://www.healthit.gov/patients-families/blue-button/about-blue-button">Blue Button</a> is a U.S. initiative to give Americans access to their health records. Through 2016, I'll be working as an Associate Entrepreneur in Residence with the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services to implement the Blue Button for Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries.</p>
			<p>This is an open source effort. Most of my work will be focused on the <a href="https://github.com/karlmdavis/FHIR-Server">FHIR-Server</a> project.</p>
