== Ubuntu 8.10 64bit Desktop, Clean Install ==

Here's what I did:
 1. Setup Vista Home Premium SP1 on drive (see BrooksSetup).
 1. Booted from Ubuntu install CD into Live CD Desktop.
 1. Moved Windows partition to front of drive (it was off by 1MB for some reason) and resized it to around 80GB.
 1. Ran Ubuntu install from Live CD environment.
    1. Used the ''Guided - use the largest continuous free space'' option in partitioner.  Please note that this may display the resulting disk layout incorrectly as only having Ubuntu-- this can be ignored.
    1. I opted to create a `localuser` account (as opposed to a `karl` account).
 1. After rebooting into the new Ubuntu system, I installed the available updates before doing anything else:
{{{
# apt-get update
# apt-get dist-upgrade
}}}


== OpenSSH Server ==

Install it:
{{{
# apt-get install openssh-server
}}}


== X Setup ==

Advanced setup for dual monitors:
 1. Get back to a default xorg.conf file:
{{{
# dpkg-reconfigure -phigh xserver-xorg
}}}
 1. Use `aticonfig` to enable the fglrx driver:
{{{
# aticonfig --initial --overlay-type=Xv --overlay-on=0
}}}
 1. Configure the primary monitor's resolutions:
{{{
# aticonfig --resolution=0,1600x1200,1280x1024,1024x768,800x600
}}}
 1. Configure the secondary monitor's resolutions:
{{{
# aticonfig --mode2=1280x1024,1024x768,800x600
}}}
 1. Configure the dual-head setup:
{{{
# aticonfig --desktop-setup=horizontal --sync-vsync=on
}}}
 1. Switch the secondary monitor from left to right (shouldn't be necessary, but is):
    1. Open ''Applications --> Accessories --> ATI Catalyst Control Center''.
    1. Select the ''Display Manager'' node.
    1. Switch to the ''Multi-Display'' tab.

== Disabling avahi ==

avahi causes problems with .local domains.  It appears the new version checks for the presence of these domains at startup, but this can still be an issue when using VPN.

To disable avahi discovery, edit the "hosts" line in /etc/nsswitch.conf as follows:
{{{
#hosts:          files mdns4_minimal [NOTFOUND=return] dns mdns4 <-- This line edited to resolve avahi and *.local DNS issues
hosts:          files mdns4_minimal dns mdns4
}}}

Restart.

== HP Photosmart C4500 All-in-one Printer ==

References:

To setup this printer for a wireless connection, the setup software that came with it must be run once from a Windows computer connected to the printer.

Instal the PyQT libraries on the Linux computer for a graphical version of the printer setup (highly recommended):
{{{
# apt-get install python-qt3
}}}

After the printer's wireless connection has been setup, run the following on the Linux computer:
{{{
# hp-setup
}}}

If automatic discovery fails, select '''Find Manually...''' and enter the IP (likely `192.168.1.103`).  It did not have a driver listed for the 4500 series but selecting the 4400 series driver seems to have worked (though printing a test page failed).


== Video Flickering with Compiz Enabled ==

It's a known bug.  Seems that Nvidia's driver replaces large portions of X to get around it.  AMD may have a fix out in their driver, but that fix is definitely not in Intrepid as of 2009-04-02.

Here's the bug:

Here's a set of workarounds that sacrifice performance to reduce seizures:
