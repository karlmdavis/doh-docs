This AsimovSetup sub-guide documents the steps necessary to make the computer a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vsftpd vsftpd] FTP server.


== Installation & Configuration ==

First, install the `vsftpd` package:
{{{
# apt-get install vsftpd
}}}

Make the following changes to parameters in the `/etc/vsftpd.conf` file:
 * Disable anonymous access:
{{{
anonymous_enable=NO
anon_upload_enable=NO
anon_mkdir_write_enable=NO
}}}
 * Enable logins by local UNIX accounts and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chroot chroot] their sessions:
{{{
local_enable=YES
chroot_local_user=YES
}}}
 * Enable uploads/writes:
{{{
write_enable=YES
}}}
 * Enable & configure SSL:
{{{
ssl_enable=YES
ssl_tlsv1=YES
force_local_logins_ssl=YES
}}}
 * Restrict logins to whitelisted accounts:
{{{
userlist_enable=YES
userlist_deny=NO
userlist_file=/etc/vsftpd.user_list
}}}
 * Create an artificial login failure delay (to mitigate brute force attacks):
{{{
delay_failed_login=10
}}}


== Backup Target: FDC ==

This FTP server is an offsite backup target for Farwest Development & Construction (FDC).

The FDC data is stored on a separate physical drive, which the virtual machine client must be given direct access to.  The following steps will accomplish this:
 1. Unmount the drive on the virtual machine's host computer (if it's already mounted).
 1. Check the host's `/etc/fstab` file to ensure that the drive will not be mounted automatically at next boot.
 1. Open the virtual machine server's console and add physical disk to the virtual machine client, giving it access to the entire drive (as opposed to just a single partition).
 1. Run the following command on the virtual machine client to list all of the drives:
{{{
# fdisk -l
}}}
 1. Make note of the device node for the FDC drive, e.g. `/dev/sdc`.  In the following steps, replace any occurrences of "`/dev/sdx`" with the correct device node.

If the FDC drive is not already partitioned, create a new `ext3` partition on it as follows:
    1. Run the following command and make a note of the size of the drive in megabytes:
{{{
# fdisk -l /dev/sdx
}}}
    1. Run the following commands to create a single primary partition that occupies the entire drive:
{{{
# parted /dev/sdx
(parted) mkpart primary ext3 0.0 <drive-size-in-MB>
(parted) quit
}}}
    1. Reboot the computer:
{{{
# reboot
}}}
    1. Format the partition:
{{{
# mkfs.ext3 /dev/sdx1
}}}

Mount the drive's partition:
 1. Run the following command and make a note of the partition's UUID, e.g. "`fd69931c-c6ba-49bd-bee7-d9470b273ad7`":
{{{
# vol_id -u /dev/sdx1
}}}
 1. Add the following lines to the end of the `/etc/fstab` file:
{{{
# Entry for /dev/sdx1 <-> /mnt/fdc:
UUID=<partition's-uuid-from-vol_id-command> /mnt/fdc ext3 defaults 0 2
}}}
 1. Create the mount point for the partition:
{{{
# mkdir /mnt/fdc
}}}
 1. Mount everything in `fstab`:
{{{
# mount -a
}}}
 1. Verify that the partition was mounted:
{{{
# mount -l
}}}

Create the `fdcbackup` user, making sure to write down the password for it:
{{{
# adduser fdcbackup --home /mnt/fdc
# chown -R fdcbackup:fdcbackup /mnt/fdc
}}}

Add an entry for the `fdcbackup` user to the `/etc/vsftpd.userlist` file.


=== parted Error: "Unable to open /dev/sdx - unrecognised disk label" ===

Apparently, parted has trouble with disks whose sectors aren't 512 bytes.  It seems that `.vmdk` "disks" often have this characteristic.

To get around it, don't use parted: use cfdisk, instead.  For example, to create an ext3 partition on `/dev/sdh/` in cfdisk, do the following:
 1. Start cfdisk for the device:
{{{
# cfdisk /dev/sdh
}}}
 1. Select '''New'''.
 1. Select '''Primary'''.
 1. Enter the partition size that is desired and press `ENTER`.
 1. Select '''Write''' and enter "`yes`".
 1. Select '''Quit'''.


== Backup Target: RGI ==

This FTP server is an offsite backup target for Ridgetop Group, Inc. (RGI).

The setup for this FTP backup service is the same as for the FDC backup, with the following details:
 * Backup User: `rgibackup`
 * Backup partition mount point: `/mnt/rgi`


== Backup Target: IFL ==

This FTP server is an offsite backup target for Integrity First Lending (IFL).

The setup for this FTP backup service is the same as for the FDC backup, with the following details:
 * Backup User: `iflbackup`
 * Backup partition mount point: `/mnt/ifl`
