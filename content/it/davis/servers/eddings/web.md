# <%= @item[:title] %>

This <%= topic_link("/it/davis/servers/eddings/") %> sub-guide describes the steps necessary to make the computer a web server, using [Apache httpd](http://httpd.apache.org/).

Previously, I'd been using `tolkien` as a web server, which has now been decommissioned. The documentation for the old `tolkien` web server is archived in the following pages:

* <%= wiki_entry_link("TolkienSetupSvn") %>
* <%= wiki_entry_link("TolkienSetupTrac") %>
* <%= wiki_entry_link("TolkienSetupWebDav") %>
* <%= wiki_entry_link("TolkienSetupWordpress") %>

Please note that all of those services (SVN, Trac, WebDAV, and WordPress) are no longer being used. I was uncomfortable with their security and usabilty and have opted for the following alternatives:

* My SVN repositories were all migrated to [GitHub](https://github.com/karlmdavis) and [bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/karlmdavis).
* My Trac projects have all been either converted into this [nanoc](http://nanoc.stoneship.org/)-powered site or archived.
* My WebDAV shares were all decommissioned.
* My WordPress blog was migrated into this [nanoc](http://nanoc.stoneship.org/)-powered site: <%= topic_link("/blog/") %>.

The portions of my web content now generated by [nanoc](http://nanoc.stoneship.org/) are all hosted by the [Apache httpd](http://httpd.apache.org/) server described in this page.

Much of the content for this page was derived from Ubuntu's Apache web server documentation: <https://help.ubuntu.com/10.04/serverguide/httpd.html>.


## Installing Apache httpd

[Apache's httpd](http://www.isc.org/software/bind) seems to be, by far, the most popular web server package for Linux. I've had good success with it, myself. Installing it is as simple as:

    $ sudo apt-get install apache2


## Basic Configuration

The Apache web server supports [virtual hosts](http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/vhosts/): the ability to serve different web sites based on the URL and/or IP used to access the site. The default Ubuntu install of Apache will create and enable a `default` virtual site that displays a basic "It Works!" message. We want to disable this site:

    $ sudo a2dissite default
    $ sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 reload


## SSL Encryption

References:

* [Apache: Force HTTPS Connections](http://www.cyberciti.biz/tips/howto-apache-force-https-secure-connections.html)
* [Httpd Wiki: SSL with Virtual Hosts Using SNI](http://wiki.apache.org/httpd/NameBasedSSLVHostsWithSNI)

By default, Apache uses unencrypted HTTP for all traffic. This means that all of the traffic, including any usernames and passwords entered, are sent out as (essentially) clear text, viewable by anyone who happens to be listening. For security, it's best to force all traffic to instead use encrypted HTTPS.

First, enable Apache's [mod_ssl](http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/mod_ssl.html) module:

    $ sudo a2enmod ssl

Enable SSL virtual hosts by adding a `NameVirtualHost *:443` directive to the `/etc/apache2/ports.conf` file, as follows:

~~~~
# ... snip

<IfModule mod_ssl.c>
    # If you add NameVirtualHost *:443 here, you will also have to change
    # the VirtualHost statement in /etc/apache2/sites-available/default-ssl
    # to <VirtualHost *:443>
    # Server Name Indication for SSL named virtual hosts is currently not
    # supported by MSIE on Windows XP.
    Listen 443
    NameVirtualHost *:443
</IfModule>

<IfModule mod_gnutls.c>
    Listen 443
    NameVirtualHost *:443
</IfModule>

# ... snip
~~~~

The rest of the SSL configuration is provided below, as part of the `justdavis.com` site configuration.


### Create Site: justdavis.com

References:

* <http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/vhosts/ip-based.html>
* <http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/core.html#options>

The `justdavis.com` domain will be used to serve static web content generated by `nanoc`.

Create the folders that will be used to store the content, logs, etc. for the site:

    $ sudo mkdir -p /var/apache2/justdavis.com/www/
    $ sudo mkdir -p /var/apache2/justdavis.com/logs/
    $ sudo chown -R root:root /var/apache2/justdavis.com/
    $ sudo chmod -R u=rwX,g=rX,o=rX /var/apache2/justdavis.com/

Create the SSL site configuration in `/etc/apache2/sites-available/justdavis.com-ssl`:

~~~~

	DocumentRoot /var/apache2/justdavis.com/www/

Create the non-SSL site configuration in `/etc/apache2/sites-available/justdavis.com`:

~~~~
<VirtualHost *:80>
        ServerName justdavis.com

        DocumentRoot /var/apache2/justdavis.com/www/
        LogLevel warn
        ErrorLog /var/apache2/justdavis.com/logs/error_log
        TransferLog /var/apache2/justdavis.com/logs/access_log

        ServerAdmin webmaster@justdavis.com

        # Redirect all HTTP (port 80) traffic for this virtual host to HTTPS.
        RewriteEngine on
        RewriteCond %{HTTPS} off
        RewriteRule (.*) https://%{HTTP_HOST}%{REQUEST_URI}
</VirtualHost>
~~~~

Enable the sites as follows:

    $ sudo a2ensite justdavis.com-ssl
    $ sudo a2ensite justdavis.com
    $ sudo service apache2 restart


### Create Site: madrivercode.com

References:

* <http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/vhosts/ip-based.html>
* <http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/mod_rewrite.html>
* <http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/core.html#options>

The `madrivercode.com` domain isn't really hosting anything directly at this time; it's been mostly replaced by `justdavis.com` (at least for the time being). Accordingly, it just needs to redirect some of its old content to the appropriate new `justdavis.com` URL.

Create the folders that will be used to store the content, logs, etc. for the site:

    $ sudo mkdir -p /var/apache2/madrivercode.com/www/
    $ sudo mkdir -p /var/apache2/madrivercode.com/logs/
    $ sudo chown -R root:root /var/apache2/madrivercode.com/
    $ sudo chmod -R u=rwX,g=rX,o=rX /var/apache2/madrivercode.com/

Create the site configuration in `/etc/apache2/sites-available/madrivercode.com`:

~~~~
<VirtualHost *:80>
	ServerName madrivercode.com
	ServerAlias madriverdevelopment.com
	ServerAlias simplepersistence.com

	DocumentRoot /var/apache2/madrivercode.com/www/
	LogLevel warn
	ErrorLog /var/apache2/madrivercode.com/logs/error_log
	TransferLog /var/apache2/madrivercode.com/logs/access_log

	ServerAdmin webmaster@madrivercode.com

	Options FollowSymLinks

	# Redirects from http://madrivercode.com/blog/ to https://justdavis.com/karl/blog/
	RewriteEngine on
	# Redirect: resume:
	RewriteRule ^/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/karlmdavis-resume.pdf(.*) https://justdavis.com/karl/downlo$

	# Redirect: everything else:
	RewriteRule ^/blog(.*) https://justdavis.com/karl/blog/ [R=permanent,L]
</VirtualHost>
~~~~

Enable the site as follows:

    $ sudo a2enmod rewrite
    $ sudo a2ensite madrivercode.com
    $ sudo service apache2 restart


### SSL Certificate

Note that the configuration above references an SSL certificate and key file. Originally, this site used a certificate generated from a self-signed CA. However, this got to be annoying as most browsers require users to accept a click-through warning when using such certificates.

To solve this annoyance, the site now uses a commercial SSL certificate with `justdavis.com` and `*.justdavis.com` as DNS names. This certificate was obtained from [StartSSL](http://www.startssl.com/), which provides reasonably priced certificates.

After purchase, the certificates were stored in the following AFS directory: `/afs/justdavis.com/user/karl/id/startcom/justdavis.com-wildcardCert-2013-03-30`. The following commands were then run on `eddings` to copy the certificate files to the directories used by Apache and other services:

    $ kinit karl
    $ aklog
    $ mkdir ~/justdavis.com-wildcard-staging
    $ cp /afs/justdavis.com/user/karl/id/startcom/justdavis.com-wildcardCert-2013-03-30/* ~/justdavis.com-wildcard-staging
    $ cd ~/justdavis.com-wildcard-staging
    $ sudo cp justdavis.com-wildcardCert-2013-03-30-keyWithoutPassword.key /etc/ssl/private/justdavis.com-wildcard.key
    $ shred -u justdavis.com-wildcardCert-2013-03-30-keyWithoutPassword.key
    $ sudo chmod u=rw,g=r,o= /etc/ssl/private/justdavis.com-wildcard.key
    $ sudo chown root:ssl-cert /etc/ssl/private/justdavis.com-wildcard.key
    $ sudo cp justdavis.com-wildcardCert-2013-03-30-ca-root.pem /etc/ssl/certs/justdavis.com-wildcard-ca-root.pem
    $ sudo cp justdavis.com-wildcardCert-2013-03-30-ca-intermediate.pem /etc/ssl/certs/justdavis.com-wildcard-ca-intermediate.pem
    $ sudo cp justdavis.com-wildcardCert-2013-03-30.crt /etc/ssl/certs/justdavis.com-wildcard.crt
    $ cd ~
    $ rm -rf ~/justdavis.com-wildcard-staging
