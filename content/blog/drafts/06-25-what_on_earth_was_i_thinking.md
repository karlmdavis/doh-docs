What on earth was I thinking, deciding to spend my free time building a Rock-Paper-Scissors game? For well over a year now, I've been a good bit of my evening and weekend time to the most absurd side project I could invent: [RPS Tourney](https://github.com/karlmdavis/rps-tourney). Why would I spend my time on something so silly? Good question!

Back when I started this project, I'd found myself spending more time at work on management and sales tasks than on coding. This made me sad. Also, I wanted to be one of those cool kids with awesome-sauce code up on GitHub. I was jealous of their great fame and general excellence. So: I needed a side project.

Unfortunately though, my current employer has a rather regressive IP assignment agreement. Most of the actually interesting side project ideas I've come up with over the years would have run afoul of it, and I'd have been spending my free time "donating" the extra output to them. After spending a lot of time frustrated by this, I eventually embraced it: if I couldn't work on anything lucrative or important, I'd work on something completely absurd, instead.

And thus [RPS Tourney](https://github.com/karlmdavis/rps-tourney) was born!

It's turned out to be a wonderfully blank canvas. It's very similar to *Whose Line Is It Anyway*, "the show where everything's made up and the points don't matter." The actual "game" portion of the project is vanishingly small, and has been done for ages and ages. Instead, I've been able to use the project to slowly explore design, technology, UX, etc.

One of the things I really wanted to do with the project was to investigate various libraries, technologies, etc. that I hadn't yet had a good excuse to play with at my "day job." A lot of these technologies fell into the category of "I think it's probably awful, but it's quite popular so I wonder if I'm wrong." JSP and Spring are prime examples of this. That experiment turned out to be fascinatingâ€”incredibly painful, but fascinating. I'll probably write more about it in a future post; there's a lot to talk about.

Probably the most fascinating part of the project for me has been my attempt to release it as a [minumum viable product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product) (though "product" is a bit of a misstatement for a free game with no revenue model). Early experiments with my wife and a few select friends very quickly proved to me that my idea of "rough, but useable" looked more like a hot, confused mess to them. Accordingly, I'm now working towards a ["milestone **4**" release](https://github.com/karlmdavis/rps-tourney/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=milestone%3A2.0.0-milestone.4+), when I'd expected to have shipped the final one sometime last year. This experience has really reshaped my thoughts on the importance of good user interface and experience design.

I really never expected this silly, throw-away side project of mine to capture my interest as much as it has. Even more surprisingly, I can see myself continuing to poke at it and use it as an excuse to play with new things for years more.
