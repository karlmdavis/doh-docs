Blows my mind. I mean, it doesn't *feel* like a decade. Decades are *weighty*. Shouldn't they take longer, pass more slowly? Shouldn't I have learned more, done more?

Don't get me wrong: I'm proud of lots of the things I got to build, and proud of how they helped users. I'm proud of the times I was able to help my teammates, of the times I was able to teach them a bit in the process. I'm proud of all the extra hours I put in on all of that, and of how much effort I put into learning and growing.

But. Looking back on the past decade, there are a few things that I'm **really** proud of, and I can't help but wish that I'd spent more time on things like them. I don't think I've enjoyed anything quite as much as I've enjoyed mentoring and working with junior engineers. Right behind that, I love the work I'm doing now on [CMS' Blue Button](http://go.cms.gov/bluebutton): putting together a completely open source solution that will directly improve the lives of over 30 million Medicare beneficiaries. Also, I love the commitment I demonstrated working on my [silly side project]({% post_url 2015-07-27-what-on-earth-was-i-thinking %}) for over two years, once I'd realized that I was starting to stagnate at IBM. There are lots of other things I look back on with pride, of course, but those are the highlights.

Thinking about it some, I can boil those down to these themes:

1. I love helping other engineers.
2. I love contributing back to society with open source projects.
3. I love committing myself to big projects and seeing them through.

The challenge, I think, will be ensuring that my next decade is full of those things, and less full of other stuff.

Have you been working for a while now, yourself? Which parts of your career do you look back on the most fondly? Which projects would you go back and do a dozen different times? Which roles did you find yourself in that were (perhaps unexpectedly) the most fulfilling? I think these kinds of things are a bit different for everyone, but that's okay.

Maybe for you, there was that whole entire month of flow-state, where you felt like Neo seeing the code for the first time. Or perhaps you ended up managing a team for a bit, and found it to be way more rewarding (and hard!) than you would have guessed. Maybe you were a developer that spent a couple of weeks pretending to be a UX expert, and have been reading up on it ever since, to try to make that a reality.

Whatever it is, I'm sure there's something you've worked on that you'd really like to do a whole lot more of. So.

**Go make it happen!**

Save up a bit of a stash, and then go start taking some calculated risks with your career. Start pushing for that other role at work that you're dreaming of. Start spending your evenings and weekends building up that side business that you hope will someday be a full-time gig. Start studying, practicing, and going on interviews to land that awesome job with those awesome folks that you'd love to work with. Do whatever it is you need to do. If you think about it for a while, you'll figure out what steps to take that will help get you from where you are to where you want to be.

How about me? What am I doing to follow my own advice? Well, for one, I'm [trying to be more like b0rk]({% post_url 2016-05-10-content-trade-deficit %})—thus this blog post. I'm also gearing up here to start spending my evenings and weekends on a side project again. Still not exactly sure what, but I miss the routine I had going back at IBM working on [rps-tourney](https://github.com/karlmdavis/rps-tourney) every day. I really miss the satisfaction I got from knowing that, every day, I was investing in myself at least a little bit. Time to get back to that.
