excerpt: "TODO"
---

Like most coders, I like to think that my favorite libraries are the best libraries, and all the other people with different favorites are wrong, and possibly stupid. I mean, it's just blatantly obvious that Wicket TODO is the best Java web framework out there, if you just take the time to properly research things. Duh.

On a more serious note, I have a hard time deciding if we coders put too much importance on library choice, or not enough. It's clearly important, butâ€¦ maybe not as important as we sometimes think. As part of my silly side project, I decided to test that a bit. When I was laying out the architecture TODO, I tried to avoid choosing my favorite libraries and instead just pick the most popular ones:

TODO table or list of libraries

Having worked with these libraries for a while, I think I'm in a good position to evaluate them. By and large, my initial suspicions were correct: I didn't much enjoy working with these libraries. They all got the job done, but often weren't very elegant or very easy to work with.

TODO Spring di

TODO jsp

TODO Spring mvc

TODO Apache cxf

TODO jQuery, maybe

TODO bootstrap

In the end, though, I'm still pretty happy with my project's code quality.
