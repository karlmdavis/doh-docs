Twice now in my career, I've found myself hating my job.

The first time was actually all the way back in college, as a Computer Science major (school itself being the "job"). I was an undergrad at the University of Arizona, was a really poor student (I had a lot of growing up to do), and found myself hating most of my classes. There were a couple of exceptions here and there, but for the most part, the CS curriculum had somehow managed to suck all of the fun out of coding for me. That came as a bit of a shock: I'd been coding since I first came across an Apple //e in the junior high library. From there, I'd picked up QBasic at home, then later HyperCard when the library picked up some newer computers, and eventually VB6 in high school. I never built anything "serious" but I always found myself playing around in code just for giggles. Someday, I'm going to go backup spelunking, and see if I can dig up any of that stuff…

Anyways, almost all of my college CS assignments were about *solving problems*. Nothing more creative than your typical math homework, really. Take some input, munge it around, and produce some output. I **did** enjoy one class, where we had a group project to create a simple [Qubic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3-D_Tic-Tac-Toe) game. But other than that, the work was mostly soulless. Nothing creative, nothing that had any life beyond the assignment. And so… I just lost interest in it. I then spent a few years wandering around from major to major, never really getting much of anywhere.

But! Somewhere in the middle of being so academically lost, I started coding again—just for giggles. For some reason (now lost to time) I decided to start building a graphing calculator in Java. Good ole' Swing! In the process, I found myself learning about parsing and syntax trees, the basics of compilers, and wait a second—it turns out that coding is fun again! I'd forgotten that it could be.

From there, one thing led to another: I started playing around with .NET to automate bits & pieces of the sysadmin job I had in school. That eventually led to a couple of small side contracts with acquaintances to build some ASP.NET webapps. Those small side contracts led to a part-time position at a contract shop. That part-time position led me to a full-time position writing Java at a small startup. Boom! Suddenly I was a full-time, professional coder. Quite the change for someone who'd quit CS because coding was awful and boring.

It took me **years** to get there, though. And it's ridiculous that such a silly little project — a graphing calculator, of all things — was the key that turned things around. The project itself wasn't really important, though. It was that I was actually *creating* something. Something I could run myself that actually *did* something useful. Made all the difference; if it hadn't been for that silly calculator project, I'd probably be unemployed right now, trying to convince someone that a Political Science degree is actually useful.

Later on in my career — just a couple of years ago, actually — I found myself in a very similar spot. I was working for IBM at the time, and over the course of my career there had found myself getting more and more sales and managerial responsibilities, and hardly any time for any engineering work. It sucked. Don't get me wrong: I'm weird and actually *like* writing proposals and statements of work and stuff like that. And I **love** leading a team, mentoring junior devs, and all of that. But I **love, love** coding, and I wasn't getting to do any of it.

Again: I needed to be creating, so I invented a silly side project for myself. I wrote about this a bit in [What On Earth Was I Thinking?!]({% post_url 2015-07-27-what-on-earth-was-i-thinking %}), but the short of it is this: I decided to create a silly game. That got me through a rough year or so at IBM, where the only coding I had time to do was at night, working on it. And it was silly. And mostly pointless. But it made me happy. I had an excuse to try out new libraries and tools again. I had an excuse to try out different coding styles and best practices and such again. I was learning, and I was creating something! For the second time, a silly side project kept my career from going in a very different — and less fun — direction.

So. If [Rule #1 is "Always Be Learning"]({% post_url 2016-06-08-rule-one-always-be-learning %}), then Rule #2 is this:

<span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:1.5em;">Always Be Creating</span>

Creating things can be deeply fulfilling. Applying your skills and abilities to produce something that exists independently outside of you is… kind of magical, really. Deep magic. The happiest people I know all have some sort of creative-/creation-related outlet: woodworking, gardening, pottery, etc.<a id="ref-1-source"><sup>[[1]](#ref-1-target)</sup></a> Anyways, my point is that creating things satisfies some pretty deep urges in the human spirit.

I often come across engineering managers that "used to" code, or design, or whatever. I always feel… worried for them. I mean, you don't *have* to keep your hand in coding to be a good manager, but it **really** helps. Similarly, I've come across a lot of "technical architects" that haven't coded in ages, and spend most of their time in Powerpoint. Again, it's not necessarily *impossible* to do a good job that way, but it's super hard. Things just move so fast. And yeah, there are absolutely some foundational principles that won't necessarily change, but if you're not staying on top of things, how will you verify that? I think [Carmack](https://twitter.com/ID_AA_Carmack) is a great example here: he's stayed as technical and hands-on as can be, all the way up to CTO.

Those two rules — Always Be Learning and Always Be Creating — are actually deeply interrelated: learning is fun and important, but if you're not feeding it into something, it's ultimately a bit pointless. Learn about your craft and then practice your craft. Whatever that craft is. Practice is required to validate your learning. Almost certainly, you'll also end up learning/discovering things on your own and you can then share those lessons with other folks.

I love finding new, interesting stuff to read and sharing it with other folks. I'm also trying to get better about writing about the things that I'm creating and learning as I go. Enter your email below and I'll send you weekly letters with the things I'm writing and the best stuff I've found in my own web wanderings.
