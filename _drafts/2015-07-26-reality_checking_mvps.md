TODO: This needs a real title.

This one Markdown file is the most interesting experiment I've ever run: [RPS Tourney: Work Log](https://github.com/kar

I put together a simple little Python script that parses the data into a somewhat more structured CSV file. I then dump

TODO: just use this table to list some of the basic statistics

<table>
       <thead>
               <tr><th></th></tr>
       </thead>
       <tbody>
       </tbody>
</table>

Enough background... let's look at the data!

TODO: Finish the parsing Python script.

```
