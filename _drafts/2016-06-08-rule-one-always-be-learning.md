I often have trouble writing. Not with the mechanics or flow of it, but just getting started. It's not really "Writer's Block", it's just the struggle to overcome the belief that — with all of the incredible, amazing content already out there — there just isn't anything for me to contribute. There are so many other productive, smart, wonderful folks producing so much great reading material that anything I feel is important must have already been covered.

Here's the thing, though: you're not reading any of that other stuff right now. Instead, you're here reading this. That's an opportunity to provide you with some small amount of value that I shouldn't pass up. A wonderful opportunity!

So. What do I want to convey to you more than anything else? There's really only one guideline for your career that I'm convinced is 100% completely absolute, and it's this:

<span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:1.5em;">Always Be Learning</span>

Every day. No exceptions. Blogs, books, YouTube, podcasts, Twitter, whatever. Just make sure that — at the end of the day — you know more about *something* related to your job than you did at the start of the day.

Why? Because it's a first step that will lead to so many other good things in your career. Being on top of the state of the art in your field makes it **much** easier for you to switch jobs, which means that you're far more likely to end up at a place that you're happy with and well-compensated by. Wherever you work, you can contribute more: you'll know how to do things better, faster, and cheaper. You'll be able to advise others on how best to do things, and what paths are best to be avoided. If you're aware of all the interesting advances in your field, you'll have the option of trying them out yourself, which is usually tons of fun. Most importantly, though, you'll have to worry about being *stuck* a lot less: your skills won't be in danger of stagnating, and will be more transferrable.

If you're an engineer, you should be finding smart engineers and forums to follow, marching through their entire back catalog, and then subscribing to their RSS feed in [feedly](https://feedly.com/) or whatever to stay on top of all their new stuff. Need some to start with? I'd recommend...

* [Steve Yegge's new blog](http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/) and also [his old "Drunken Rants" blog](https://sites.google.com/site/steveyegge2/blog-rants).
* The [/r/programming](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming) subreddit, but start by chewing through the first few pages of its ["Greatest Hits" catalog](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/top/?sort=top&t=all).
* [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/), which is often full of obnoxious brogrammer startup-worshippers, but is also often full of amazingly kind and thoughtful folks. Bit of a crapshoot. But you might start with its ["best" list](https://news.ycombinator.com/best), which contains its recent high-ranking posts.
* [The Mythical Man Month](http://www.amazon.com/Mythical-Man-Month-Software-Engineering-Anniversary/dp/0201835959), which is just a timeless classic that all engineers and managers should read.
* [Continuous Delivery](http://martinfowler.com/books/continuousDelivery.html), which I haven't yet finished but is absolutely fantastic.
* The [Software Engineering Radio](http://www.se-radio.net/) podcast. Not every episode is great, but the great ones are probably worth listening to three times. (By the way, if you're on Android and need a podcast player, I'd recommend [Pocket Casts](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=au.com.shiftyjelly.pocketcasts&hl=en). It's not perfect, but it's pretty solid.)
* [Julia Evans' blog](http://jvns.ca/) is also a must-read. She does a better job than anyone else I've come across of making really really complicated things understandable. And her enthusiasm is infectious.

If you're an engineering manager? Same thing: find the folks out there that are saying smart things and read everything they put out. I'd recommend...

* [The Mythical Man Month](http://www.amazon.com/Mythical-Man-Month-Software-Engineering-Anniversary/dp/0201835959). It's listed for both engineers and managers, but for managers it holds pride of first place. If you haven't yet read it, stop reading this, stop whatever else you're doing, go buy it, and read it immediately. It really is that important.
* [Rands in Repose](http://randsinrepose.com/dont-skip-this/). I will read any & every thing that this man writes. Always worth my time.
* [Lean Enterprise](http://www.amazon.com/Lean-Enterprise-Performance-Organizations-Innovate/dp/1449368425/ref=asap_bc?ie=UTF8). I'm still reading through this, but I feel like I'm highlighting every other sentence in it. And yeah, this is the second book I've listed that Jez Humble has co-authored. He's really smart.

As an advanced move, you should probably also start following on Twitter the smart folks that I've listed or that you come across on Reddit or HN. After keeping up with all of that stuff above for several years, I find that I'm getting more value from Twitter than anything else these days. Not sure if that'd be true if you're just starting out, though.

Anyways. You don't have to read all of that tonight (unless you're an engineering manager and haven't read Mythical Man Month, which you need to fix ASAP), or even this week, but you should definitely get started. Read/watch/listen to something every day. Carve out at least 30 minutes for it. It's **super important**. Seriously. Year-from-now-you will thank yourself for it.

I love finding new, interesting stuff to read and sharing it with other folks. I'm also trying to get better about writing down the things that I learn as I go. Enter your email below and I'll send you weekly letters with the things I'm writing and the best stuff I've found in my own web wanderings.
