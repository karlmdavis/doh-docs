This KerrSetup sub-guide describes the steps necessary to connect the computer to remote networks via VPN.


== PPTP ==

PPTP is probably the most common VPN protocol/client, as it is the default for Microsoft's RRAS.  Please note that the PPTP configuration GUI in some recent Ubuntu releases has been broken in various... interesting ways.

TODO


== IPSEC & L2TP ==

The combination of IPSEC (encryption) and L2TP (network access) is a fairly cross-platform one and is considered far more secure than PPTP.


=== Installing [http://www.openswan.org/ Openswan] ===

The VPN client's IPSEC component will be provided by [http://www.openswan.org/ Openswan].  For Linux kernels >= 2.6, Openswan does not require the use of any additional kernel modules.

Later on in this guide, we will install `xl2tpd`, which provides L2TP services for our VPN client.  `xl2tpd` is only available in APT since Ubuntu Hardy.  If it is not yet available in APT for the computer in question, both Openswan and xl2tpd will have to be installed from source.


==== Installing via APT ====

Run the following command to install Openswan:
{{{
# apt-get install openswan
}}}

When prompted during installation, select/enter the following options:
 * Do you wish to enable opportunistic encryption in Openswan?: ''No''
 * Do you want to create a RSA public/private keypair for this host ?: ''Yes''
 * Which type of RSA keypair do you want to create ?: ''plain''

Edit the `/etc/ipsec.conf` file and add the following section to configure the `eddings` half of any IPSEC connections:
{{{
# The left-side eddings configuration for all connections
conn	eddings.davisonlinehome.name
	left=75.146.134.33
	leftsubnets=75.146.134.32/29 192.168.1.0/24
	leftnexthop=%direct
	leftid=@eddings.davisonlinehome.name
	leftrsasigkey=%cert
	leftcert=/etc/ssl/certs/davisonlinehome.name.crt
}}}

Edit the `/etc/ipsec.conf` file and add the following section to configure the an IPSEC connection for the backup server, `sanderson`:
{{{
# Connection to eddings for kerr when kerr is offsite
conn	eddings-kerr-offsite
	# edding's details
	left=75.146.134.33
	leftsubnets={75.146.134.32/29 192.168.1.0/24}
	leftnexthop=%direct
	leftid=@eddings.davisonlinehome.name
	leftrsasigkey=TODO
	# kerr's details
	right=%any
	rightid=@kerr.davisonlinehome.name
	rightrsasigkey=TODO-RSA-KEY
	# This is a permanent host-to-subnet connection
	type=tunnel
	# We're using certificates for authentication
	authby=rsasig
	# This connection requires L2TP
	leftprotoport=17/1701
	rightprotoport=17/1701
	# Bring this connection up automatically when the IPSEC daemon starts
	auto=add
	# Restart this connection automatically when it dies
	dpdaction=restart
	# Miscellaneous settings
	forceencaps=yes
	compress=yes
}}}

The "`TODO-RSA-KEY`" entries above need to be replaced with the left & right computers' actual keys.  Connect to each computer in turn and run the following command (replace "`--left`" with "`--right`" as necessary):
{{{
# ipsec showhostkey --left
}}}

Paste the results of those commands into the appropriate places, being sure to keep the key all on one line.
