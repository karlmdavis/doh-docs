It's a pretty simple set of steps:
 1. Download the Nandroid `.zip` from the referenced link above.
 1. Extract the `.zip` on a Linux computer.
 1. Boot the phone into recovery mode (Home + Power).
 1. Connect the phone to the Linux computer via USB.
 1. Run the following commands from the extracted Nandroid folder (update the timestamps and paths to match):
{{{
$ sudo su
# PATH=/usr/local/bin/android-sdk-linux_x86-1.0_r2/tools:$PATH
# ./nandroid.sh /home/karl/Desktop/android-backup-2009-05-24-2100
}}}
 1. Copy the backup somewhere for safe-keeping.
