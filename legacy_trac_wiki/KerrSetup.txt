== Disabling avahi ==

avahi causes problems with .local domains.  It appears the new version checks for the presence of these domains at startup, but this can still be an issue when using VPN.

To disable avahi discovery, edit the "hosts" line in /etc/nsswitch.conf as follows:
{{{
#hosts:          files mdns4_minimal [NOTFOUND=return] dns mdns4 <-- This line edited to resolve avahi and *.local DNS issues
hosts:          files mdns4_minimal dns mdns4

To setup this printer for a wireless connection, the setup software that came with it must be run once from a Windows computer connected to the printer.

Instal the PyQT libraries on the Linux computer for a graphical version of the printer setup (highly recommended):
{{{
# apt-get install python-qt3
}}}

After the printer's wireless connection has been setup, run the following on the Linux computer:
{{{
# hp-setup
}}}

If automatic discovery fails, select '''Find Manually...''' and enter the IP (likely `192.168.1.103`).
