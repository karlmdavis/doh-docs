[KeePass](http://keepass.info/) is an open source and cross-platform password manager/database. It's what I use to store all of my accounts and passwords and has worked well for a number of years now.


## Installation


### Ubuntu 12.04 and Later

KeePass is a .NET application that also supports running on Linux via [Mono](http://www.mono-project.com/Main_Page).

Run the following command to install KeePass and its dependencies:

    $ sudo apt-get install keepass2
